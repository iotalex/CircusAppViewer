# Introduction üè• 
This is open source software to help people understand how $9,000 or more monthly medications fall into the different Medicare coverage gap tiers.  
The software supports the following user goals: 
‚Ä¢	Help identify when manufacturer drug assistance will be needed
‚Ä¢	Identify a list of grants used for copay assistance 
# Overview 
This is an open source software using experimental Blazer to create an environment to enter in sets of medication costs. We will begin by using a nested component under private class. The whole project begins using a standard Blazor app template.
# Project Vision  
To create a visual representation for people on high dollar Medicare medications. Some minimal explanation of the repo and directions on usage are coming soon.
-	It's going to work a lot like a trapeze artist on a balance beam at the circus.
-	We're going to make managing healthcare costs fun!
