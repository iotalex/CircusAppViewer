Experimental software using Blazer to create an environment to enter two sets of data. 
One set that on the left and the other on the right, then we'll be used to create a balance beam. Some minimal explanation of the repo and directions on usage coming soon.
It's going to work a lot like a trapeze artist on a balance beam at the circus. 
We're going to make managing healthcare costs fun!
